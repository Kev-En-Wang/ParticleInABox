# ParticleInABox
Chemical Kinetics, CHEM350

This project was done for my CHEM350 course while I was in the University of Waterloo.

It's written in python and it's used to find the discrete energy levels that are available for a particle in a box.
This model uses pyplot to find the interesections between 3 different graphs showing the available energy levels for a particle.

Honestly, I've forgotten almost all of what I've written here and so I've also added the final report so if anyone's interested in the project
feel free to take a look. DON'T PLAIGERIZE.

Main things I've learned:
How to use pylplot and find points of intersections between equations
How to interpret complex equations into something more user friendly
